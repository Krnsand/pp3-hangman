# **Hangman**
This is a classic Hangman game which in this case is a Python terminal game. It runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku written entirely in python code.
The player can guess a letter or word until the word is completed or until one runs out of lives.
My target audience is anyone who wants to play a game. Programmers might find the termial environment more intriguing, but I have used colors for an easier read for anyone not used with a terminal like this.

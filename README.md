# **Hangman**
This is a classic Hangman game which in this case is a Python terminal game. It runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku written entirely in python code.
The player can guess a letter or word until the word is completed or until one runs out of lives.
My target audience is anyone who wants to play a game. Programmers might find the termial environment more intriguing, but I have used colors for an easier read for anyone not used with a terminal like this.

    * They can see how many lives they will start out with
    * How many letters the word to guess is comprised of
    * Which letters already guessed (in this image there are no letters as it is at the start of the game and no guess has been made)

    * This is green as a visual feedback that it is a correct guess
    * The guessed letter is placed at the correct placement in the word
